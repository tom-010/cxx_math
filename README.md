Make C++ the goto-language for math
===================================

It is quite annoying to prototype in python and rewrite in C++. Make it fun to do 
math-things in C++.

## TODO

* std20 as bazel compiler option. Recommended compiler settings
* Interesting queries (targets, test, messages) as scripts
* doctests 
* dbc2test: pre- and post-conditions
* doxygen
* property based testing as doctest
* xtensor
* bdd
* muation-testing
* python, js, java, flutter bindings
* fuzzying
